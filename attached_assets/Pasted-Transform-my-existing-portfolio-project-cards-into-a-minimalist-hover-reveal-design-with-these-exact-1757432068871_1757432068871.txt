Transform my existing portfolio project cards into a minimalist hover-reveal design with these exact specifications:

UPDATE THE CARD STRUCTURE:
- Keep existing content and descriptions unchanged
- Convert each card to a two-layer system: front view (company name only) and back view (existing content)
- Front: Clean gradient background with centered company name in white text
- Back: Current card content (title, description, tags, buttons) in structured layout

ANIMATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Replace any complex animations with simple fade/slide transition
- Front card: opacity 1 to 0, translateY(0) to translateY(-10px) on hover
- Back card: opacity 0 to 1, translateY(10px) to translateY(0) on hover
- Transition duration: 0.3s ease for all properties
- No 3D transforms, rotations, or complex effects

STYLING SPECIFICATIONS:
- Card dimensions: height 240px, border-radius 8px
- Grid layout: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(380px, 1fr)) with 30px gap
- Typography: Company names 1.8em weight 600, project titles 1.2em weight 600
- Colors: #1a1a1a background, #2d2d2d cards, #00d4aa accent, #ffffff text, #b3b3b3 descriptions
- Border: 1px solid #333 on cards

GRADIENT BACKGROUNDS FOR FRONTS:
- Bike Share: linear-gradient(135deg, #00d4aa 0%, #00a087 100%)
- Wayfair: linear-gradient(135deg, #7c4dff 0%, #5e35b1 100%)  
- Olist: linear-gradient(135deg, #ff7043 0%, #e64a19 100%)

BUTTON UPDATES:
- Primary button text: "View in Tableau" (not "View Dashboard")
- Secondary button: "Read More" (links to existing detailed content)
- Button styling: 8px 16px padding, border-radius 4px, font-size 0.85em
- Primary: #00d4aa background, #1a1a1a text
- Secondary: transparent background, #00d4aa text and border

LAYOUT STRUCTURE:
- Keep existing project descriptions, tags, and all content
- Back card layout: title at top, description middle, tags below, buttons at bottom
- Tags: smaller size (0.75em), #1a1a1a background, #00d4aa text, 12px border-radius
- Maintain responsive design for mobile (single column, reduced dimensions)

The goal is clean minimalism - company name on hover reveals full project details with smooth, subtle transitions. No complex animations or visual effects.
