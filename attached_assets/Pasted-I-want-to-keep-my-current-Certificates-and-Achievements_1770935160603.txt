I want to keep my current Certificates and Achievements page structure with the two existing tabs:
Academic Excellence
Professional Certifications

Do not redesign the page. Keep the same card component style and the current tab toggle UI. This task is only to improve the structure so I can add more items cleanly and attach proof links or files.

1) Data driven content
Refactor the page so both tabs render cards from a single data array (JSON or TypeScript object) that I can easily edit to add new items.

Each card should support:
title
issuer
year
tab (Academic or Professional)
shortDescription (1 to 2 concise lines)
proofType (none, link, file, multi)
proofLabel (default: See)
proofUrl (for link)
proofFiles (array for file or multi)
proofLinks (array for multi when the proof is multiple links)
optional: subItems (array of strings for grouped awards)

2) Proof behavior
If proofType is link, the See button opens proofUrl in a new tab.
If proofType is file, the See button opens the file in a new tab at full resolution.
If proofType is multi, clicking See opens a simple modal or expandable panel listing all proofs as clickable items. Each proof opens in a new tab.
If proofType is none, do not show the See button.

3) Sorting
Sort cards by year descending within each tab. Items without a year go last.

4) Populate initial items
Use the current two Academic Excellence cards already on the page and add the following new items. Use file placeholders for certificates I will upload later.

Add to Academic Excellence tab

5) Scholarship toggle
Add a simple boolean flag in the data file such as showScholarships true or false.
If false, scholarship cards should not render, but the data remains in the array.

Make sure all new cards match the existing card layout and spacing and the tab behavior remains exactly the same.
