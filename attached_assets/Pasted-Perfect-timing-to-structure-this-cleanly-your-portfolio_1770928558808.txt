Perfect timing to structure this cleanly — your portfolio is already visually strong, so the goal is to **extend the same editorial system** without breaking design consistency.

I’ll give you:

1. Replit prompt to generate Python project cards
2. Where to place STACKWELL
3. Card content copy (ready to paste)
4. GitHub “View Project” behavior
5. How to add AI projects next (without clutter)

# 1️⃣ Master Replit Prompt (Copy Paste)

Use this to make the dev agent replicate your Tableau card style exactly.

```
I want to add new project cards to the “Featured Projects” section of my portfolio.

IMPORTANT:
Follow the exact same editorial and visual style as my existing Tableau project cards.

This includes:
• Same card size and layout
• Same image placement and overlay
• Same typography hierarchy
• Same tag styling (EDA, BI, NLP, etc.)
• Same button styling and hover effects
• Same “Read More” + “View Project” structure

Do NOT redesign anything — only duplicate the existing component structure and populate with new content.

NEW CARDS TO ADD:
These are Python based analytics projects hosted on GitHub.

Each card should include:
• Project title
• 2–3 line editorial description (business impact oriented)
• Tags (Python, NLP, Machine Learning, etc.)
• “Read More” internal page link (future ready)
• “View Project” button → redirects to GitHub repo

Ensure filtering works under:
Python | Machine Learning | NLP

Maintain responsive behavior across desktop and mobile.
```

# 2️⃣ Where To Put STACKWELL

Add STACKWELL as:

👉 First card under “All Projects”
👉 Also tagged under: “Python” or “Machine Learning” (if AI inside)

Why first?

Because:

• It’s your flagship build
• Shows product thinking
• Signals founder operator profile
• Differentiates you from analysts

Think of it as:

> “Hero product project” — not just another dashboard.

---

# 3️⃣ Project Card Copy — Ready To Paste

Use the same editorial tone as your Tableau cards.

# 4️⃣ GitHub “View Project” Behavior Prompt

Add this to Replit:

```
For all Python and AI project cards, configure the “View Project” button to redirect externally to the corresponding GitHub repository.

Requirements:
• Open in new tab
• Include GitHub icon inside button
• Maintain same styling as Tableau “View in Tableau” button
• Add hover animation consistent with existing cards
```

---

# 5️⃣ Filters To Update

Tell Replit:

```
Add filtering functionality so the new projects appear under:

• Python
• Machine Learning
• NLP
• All Projects

Ensure multi tag filtering works (example: Python + NLP).
```

---

# 6️⃣ Adding AI Projects — Structure

After Python analytics, create a new layer:

Order inside “All Projects”:

1. Stackwell (Product / AI Platform)
2. AI Meeting Analyzer
3. AI Copilot Projects
4. Predictive Models
5. Tableau Dashboards

Why?

Recruiters + founders scan top down.

You want them to see:

> Builder → AI → Analytics → Visualization

Not the reverse.

---

# 7️⃣ Future AI Project Card Titles

When ready, add:

• AI Copilot for Business Operations
• Decision Intelligence Assistant
• Workflow Automation AI Agent
• Executive KPI Prediction Engine

Keeps narrative cohesive.

---

# 8️⃣ Visual Consistency Rule

Use same image treatment as Tableau cards:

• Dark gradient overlays
• Data UI mockups
• Dashboard holographic screens

Do NOT use GitHub screenshots — too raw.

If needed, generate synthetic UI visuals.

---

If you want next, I can:

• Write all remaining project card descriptions
• Create AI Copilot card copy
• Design Stackwell hero mockup prompt
• Structure “Read More” internal case study pages

You’re turning this portfolio into a product showcase — which is exactly what early startups want to see.
