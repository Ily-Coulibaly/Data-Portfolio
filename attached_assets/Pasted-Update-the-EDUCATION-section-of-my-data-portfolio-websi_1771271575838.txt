Update the EDUCATION section of my data portfolio website.

Do NOT redesign the entire site. Keep the current visual style and card layout. Only update the content and structure of the Education section to better fit a data and AI portfolio.

Goals:
• Emphasize analytics, AI, programming, and BI relevance
• Keep it objective and resume aligned
• Remove items I specified
• Replace GPA with a single Grade line (Grade: A) for both degrees
• Avoid club leadership overload; keep only what supports data and AI positioning
