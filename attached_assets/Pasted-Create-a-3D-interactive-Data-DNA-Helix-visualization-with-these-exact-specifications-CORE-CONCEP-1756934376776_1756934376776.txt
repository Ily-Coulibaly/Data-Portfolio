Create a 3D interactive "Data DNA Helix" visualization with these exact specifications:

CORE CONCEPT:
- 3D rotating DNA helix structure with skill nodes orbiting around a central identity core
- Dark space background with floating data particles
- Mouse movement controls 3D rotation
- Hover interactions reveal detailed skill information

HTML STRUCTURE:
- Central core: "ILY KYNION" + "Data Alchemist" 
- 8 skill nodes positioned in 3D space around the core:
  * Python (🐍 PYTHON 90%) - yellow glow
  * SQL (🗄️ SQL 85%) - cyan glow  
  * Tableau (📊 TABLEAU 95%) - teal glow
  * Machine Learning (🤖 ML 88%) - red glow
  * Leadership (👑 LEADER 92%) - yellow glow
  * Analytics (📈 ANALYTICS 95%) - blue glow
  * Entrepreneur (🚀 STARTUP 90%) - purple glow
  * R (📊 R 80%) - green glow
- Outer orbit with 4 metric nodes: "1500+ Customers", "140% Growth", "2.5+ Years", "10 Countries"
- Info panel that appears on hover with skill details
- Control buttons: Normal, Hyperspeed, Slow Motion

CSS ANIMATIONS:
- Main helix rotation: 20s infinite
- Individual node spinning borders with conic-gradient
- Pulsing core with scale animation
- Floating particles with 3D movement
- Orbiting metrics with counter-rotation
- Hover effects with scale and glow
- Shimmer effects on borders

JAVASCRIPT INTERACTIONS:
- Mouse movement controls 3D perspective (rotateY and rotateX)
- Hover on skill nodes shows info panel with detailed metrics
- Speed controls change animation duration
- Generate 30 floating particles with random timing
- Smooth transitions for all interactions

VISUAL EFFECTS:
- Radial gradients for each skill node
- Box-shadows with color-matched glows
- Backdrop-filter blur effects
- Transform3d for 3D positioning
- Conic-gradient spinning borders
- Particle system with opacity animations

RESPONSIVE DESIGN:
- Mobile breakpoint at 768px
- Smaller nodes and text on mobile
- Adjusted positioning for smaller screens

Make it exactly like the provided design with the same colors, animations, and interactivity. Focus on the 3D effect and smooth animations.
