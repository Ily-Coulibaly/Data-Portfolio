Clear — you now need a **Replit builder prompt** for your portfolio (not Stackwell app this time) to structure the **Certificates & Achievements section** with filtering, scalability, and editorial consistency.

No design micromanagement — just structure, taxonomy, and behavior.

Below is the refined prompt 👇

# Replit Prompt — Certificates & Achievements Section

Copy paste this into your portfolio project.

```
I want to expand the “Certificates & Achievements” section of my portfolio to support multiple categories, filtering, and future scalability.

Do not redesign the overall portfolio aesthetic. Maintain the same editorial card structure, typography hierarchy, and interaction behavior as my existing certificate cards.

The goal is to structure achievements in a way that reflects the breadth of my profile across analytics, leadership, entrepreneurship, and academic excellence.

Please implement the following:

1. Category Framework

Create filterable categories that allow users to sort certificates and achievements dynamically.

Primary categories should include:

• Analytics & Technical Certifications
• Entrepreneurship & Venture Awards
• Leadership & Professional Development
• Academic Excellence & Scholarships
• Competitions & Honors

Ensure the filtering system allows certificates to belong to multiple categories if relevant.

Example:
A venture award could appear under both Entrepreneurship and Leadership.

2. Certificate Card Content Structure

Each certificate / achievement card should support the following fields:

• Title
• Issuing Institution / Organization
• Year
• Category Tag(s)
• Short editorial description (1–2 lines)
• “See Certificate” button

3. Certificate Viewing Behavior

When users click “See Certificate”:

• Open the certificate image or PDF in a new tab
• Support high-resolution viewing
• Allow multiple files per card (for multi-award recognitions)
• Maintain consistent button styling with existing portfolio CTAs

4. Multi-Award Grouping Logic

Allow grouping multiple recognitions under one flagship card when relevant.

Example:
“B.E.T.A Challenge Venture Awards” should contain:

• Graduate Track Grand Winner
• Social Impact Award
• High Impact Woman Founder Award

Users should be able to expand or view all associated certificates within the same card.

5. Scalability Requirements

Design the backend card structure so I can easily add new certificates later without redesigning the section.

Support:

• Additional categories
• Additional tags
• New certificate uploads
• Future leadership roles or awards

6. Filtering Interaction

Add a filter bar similar to my Projects section, allowing users to click categories such as:

All  
Analytics  
Entrepreneurship  
Leadership  
Academic  
Competitions

Ensure cards dynamically display based on filter selection.

7. Sorting Logic (Optional but Preferred)

Allow sorting by:

• Most Recent
• Category
• Institution

The goal is to transform this section into a structured achievement ecosystem rather than a static certificate gallery.

# Why Filtering Matters

It lets different viewers see you differently:

Recruiters → Analytics
Founders → Entrepreneurship
Schools → Academic
Employers → Leadership

One section, multiple narratives.

---

# Structural Best Practice

Display order inside “All” filter:

1. Venture / Entrepreneurship Awards
2. Scholarships
3. Leadership Roles
4. Competitions
5. Certifications

This leads with differentiation, not coursework.

If you want next, I can:

• Write the actual card descriptions
• Build the B.E.T.A flagship card content
• Add icon mapping per category
• Create Achievement Timeline section

But structurally, this prompt will let your certificate section scale like your project portfolio — not stay static.
