Yes — clear. And this is **excellent product depth**. You now have enough substance to position Stackwell as a **flagship systems build**, not a data project.

Below is exactly how to arrange the **Featured Project Card** inside your portfolio — including hierarchy, sections, links, tags, and interaction logic.

No aesthetics — only structure and content.

---

# 1️⃣ Card Positioning Inside Projects

**Placement**

• First card in Projects grid
• Tagged across multiple filters
• Labeled as Featured

**Why**

It is:

• Full SaaS platform
• AI system
• Data infrastructure build
• Venture product

So it must lead your technical narrative.

---

# 2️⃣ Card Information Architecture

Use this structure inside the card modal or “Read More” expansion.

---

## A. Project Title

**Stackwell — AI Powered Inventory & Decision Intelligence Platform**

Shorten only if space constrained:

**Stackwell — Inventory Intelligence SaaS**

---

## B. Editorial Description (Preview Text)

2–3 lines max:

> Stackwell is a multi tenant inventory and analytics platform with AI driven decision intelligence. It centralizes inventory operations, demand forecasting, B2B relationship health monitoring, and supply chain insights into a unified SaaS environment designed to eliminate stock blind spots and revenue leakage.

---

## C. Platform Scope Snapshot (Mini Section)

Use 4 quick bullets:

• Multi location inventory intelligence
• Predictive demand forecasting
• Retailer health & churn risk scoring
• Automated reorder decision engine

This helps skim readers grasp breadth fast.

---

## D. My Role & Ownership

Critical for credibility.

Use:

> Sole architect, engineer, and product owner — responsible for end to end platform design, data architecture, analytics infrastructure, AI orchestration, and production deployment.

This signals full stack + product ownership.

---

## E. Data & Analytics Infrastructure

Condense into card friendly language:

• 40+ PostgreSQL relational tables
• Multi domain schema (inventory, CRM, supply chain, analytics)
• Real time inventory movement tracking
• KPI aggregation pipelines
• Event tracking system replacing third party analytics

---

## F. AI & Predictive Intelligence Layer

Highlight hybrid model — it’s unique:

• Deterministic Decision Engine for auditable metrics
• Demand forecasting models with confidence scoring
• Stockout prediction & urgency tiering
• Retailer churn risk prediction
• Multi model LLM orchestration (GPT-4o + Gemini fallback)

This signals engineering maturity.

---

## G. System Architecture Signals

Use complexity indicators:

• Multi tenant SaaS data isolation
• Role based access (5 permission tiers)
• 212+ REST API endpoints
• Event driven observability layer
• AI audit logging & action approval workflows

These are credibility boosters.

---

## H. Business Impact / Use Cases

Translate tech → value:

• Prevents revenue loss from stockouts
• Automates reorder planning
• Predicts retailer inactivity risk
• Centralizes multi channel sales tracking
• Enables operational decision automation

---

# 3️⃣ Tags / Filters To Attach

Attach ALL relevant tags so it appears everywhere:

• Python
• AI
• Predictive Analytics
• SaaS
• Product Analytics
• Data Infrastructure
• Decision Intelligence

This maximizes visibility in filtering.

---

# 4️⃣ Links To Add (CTA Buttons)

Use 3 buttons:

---

### 1. Live Platform

Label:

> Live Platform

Link:

[https://stackwellapp.com](https://stackwellapp.com)

Opens new tab.

---

### 2. View Codebase

Label:

> View Codebase

Link:

(Use your GitHub URL in your actual portfolio builder.)

Purpose:

Shows engineering legitimacy.

---

### 3. Case Study (Future Ready)

Label:

> Product Case Study

Can be hidden or “Coming Soon.”

Later you’ll expand architecture diagrams, product walkthroughs, etc.

---

# 5️⃣ Card Depth Levels

Structure interaction like this:

**Surface card (grid view)**

• Title
• Short description
• Tags
• Featured badge

**Expanded modal / Read More**

• Platform overview
• Role
• Infrastructure
• AI systems
• Architecture
• Use cases
• Links

This keeps grid clean but depth accessible.

---

# 6️⃣ Complexity Signals You MUST Keep

Do not remove these — they differentiate you:

• 40+ database tables
• 212+ APIs
• Multi tenant logic
• Deterministic decision engine
• AI orchestration layer
• Event tracking system

These shift perception from:

Dashboard builder → Systems architect.

---

# 7️⃣ Narrative Positioning Line

If you want a closing line inside modal:

> Stackwell represents a full stack analytics product build combining data infrastructure, predictive intelligence, and operational decision automation within a scalable SaaS architecture.

Strong founder signal.

---

# 8️⃣ Final Card Arrangement Blueprint

When implemented, your card should flow:

1. Title
2. Editorial description
3. Platform scope snapshot
4. Role & ownership
5. Data infrastructure
6. AI intelligence
7. Architecture complexity
8. Business impact
9. Tags
10. Links

Logical → technical → value progression.

---

When you’re ready, next I can:

• Compress this into card length copy
• Write the modal case study page
• Add architecture diagram prompts
• Align language with resume bullets

But structurally — this is exactly how Stackwell should appear in your portfolio.
