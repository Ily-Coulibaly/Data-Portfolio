```
Update my Featured Projects section to include my AI projects inside the same project grid (do not create a separate AI Projects page).

1) Add a new filter button labeled: AI
Keep existing filters as well: All Projects, Python, Machine Learning, NLP, Tableau.
Place AI as the last filter (or next to NLP).

2) Filtering behavior
When a user clicks a filter, only show projects tagged with that category.
Projects can have multiple tags and should appear under every relevant filter.
“All Projects” should always show everything.

3) Add these AI projects as new Featured Project cards
Use the exact same editorial structure as my existing cards: title, short subtitle, short summary, tags, Read More link, and View button.

Project A
Title: AI Copilot Agent for Role Automation & Augmentation
Subtitle: Enterprise AI agent prototype using Copilot Studio
Tags: AI, GenAI, Automation
Buttons:
- View Report (link to my attached report)
- Read More (opens the case study page)

Project B
Title: GenAI Driven Analytics & IoT Data Innovation Strategy
Subtitle: AI powered growth intelligence for smart agriculture systems
Tags: AI, Machine Learning, Python
Buttons:

Project C
Title: Data & AI Monetization Strategy for AI Enabled Startups
Subtitle: Pricing and positioning for AI and data value capture

Project D

4) Stackwell placement and tagging
Keep Stackwell as the first Featured Project card and ensure it appears under the AI filter too.
Update Stackwell tags to include: AI, Python, Machine Learning.

5) Featured order
Set the Featured Projects order to:
1. Stackwell
2. AI Copilot Agent
3. GenAI IoT Analytics
4. AI Monetization Strategy
5. Enterprise AI Transformation
Then keep my other existing projects after.

6) View button rules
If the project is a deployed product, the View button should be “View App” and link to the live app.
If the project is a report, the View button should be “View Report” and link to the report.
If the project is code, the View button should be “View GitHub” and link to the repo.

7) Keep everything else unchanged
Do not change styling, spacing, fonts, or hover behavior.
Match the existing card layout and interactions exactly.
